-- 178. Rank Scores

-- Table: Scores

-- +-------------+---------+
-- | Column Name | Type    |
-- +-------------+---------+
-- | id          | int     |
-- | score       | decimal |
-- +-------------+---------+
-- id is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
-- Each row of this table contains the score of a game. Score is a floating point value with two decimal places.
 

-- Write a solution to find the rank of the scores. The ranking should be calculated according to the following rules:

-- The scores should be ranked from the highest to the lowest.
-- If there is a tie between two scores, both should have the same ranking.
-- After a tie, the next ranking number should be the next consecutive integer value. In other words, there should be no holes between ranks.
-- Return the result table ordered by score in descending order.

-- The result format is in the following example.

 

-- Example 1:

-- Input: 
-- Scores table:
-- +----+-------+
-- | id | score |
-- +----+-------+
-- | 1  | 3.50  |
-- | 2  | 3.65  |
-- | 3  | 4.00  |
-- | 4  | 3.85  |
-- | 5  | 4.00  |
-- | 6  | 3.65  |
-- +----+-------+
-- Output: 
-- +-------+------+
-- | score | rank |
-- +-------+------+
-- | 4.00  | 1    |
-- | 4.00  | 1    |
-- | 3.85  | 2    |
-- | 3.65  | 3    |
-- | 3.65  | 3    |
-- | 3.50  | 4    |
-- +-------+------+

SELECT SCORE, DENSE_RANK() OVER(ORDER BY SCORE DESC) AS `RANK`
FROM SCORES


-- SELECT
--     S1.score AS score,
--     COUNT(S2.Score) AS `rank`
-- FROM Scores S1, (SELECT DISTINCT score
--                 FROM Scores) S2
-- WHERE S1.score <= S2.score
-- GROUP BY S1.id
-- ORDER BY S1.score DESC
